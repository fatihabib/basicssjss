Question 1

Mutating array methods modify the original array directly

while non mutating array methods return a new array without modifying the original

Mutating array methods

push(): adds one or more elements to the end of an array and modifies the original array

pop(): removes the last element from an array and modifies the original array.

splice(): removes, adds or replaces elements from an array and modifies the original array.

shift(): removes the first element from an array and modifies the original array

sort(): sorts the elements of an array in place and modifies the original array.

Non - mutating array methods

concat(): concatenates two or more arrays and returns a new array.Example:

slice(): returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array selected from start to end.

map(): creates a new array with the results of calling a provided

function on every element in the array.

filter(): creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided

function.reduce(): executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value
